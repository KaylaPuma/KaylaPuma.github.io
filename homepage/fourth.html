<h1>WELCOME TO GORMAN PLAYGROUND!</h1>
<h2>Come read my feature article about the wonders of this playground!</h2>
<h3>A Simple Symphony</h3>

<div class= "container">

<p>   Located in the midst of East Elmhurst and sandwiched between Northern Boulevard and Astoria Boulevard, Gorman Playground is easy to spot. Therefore it makes sense that people from these different communities are brought here together. Taking up a whole block and surrounded by the three-family home buildings of the neighborhood, it is impossible to miss. Open from all sides, people can enter in any way as they please. Although I recommend entering the park through its entrance, where you'll be greeted by the green New York public park sign and the colorful environment.
</p>

<p>   First off, up front and center is the playground with the benches surrounding it like an audience facing the main stage waiting for the show to start. The children might cut off your walk as they play tag and the parents at the bench will take note of your presence before returning to watch the chase. The considerate parents are welcome to just sit at the benches and make conversation or even feel free to join their child down the slide. Next to the main playground set, two life-size stone frogs make their presence known as the park’s sprinklers by cooling down visitors in the summer. On the left proudly stands the swing set, which is always occupied, on a large thick black rubber mat radiating heat in the summer and making people embarrassingly slip several times during a snowy winter.
</p>

<p>   Then, on either middle side of the block, you are bound to see people exercising, teenagers gossiping, and park employees laughing. It is also home to the colorful chalk drawings on the sidewalk made by creative children, two Mr. Softee ice cream trucks, and the kind woman with a cart full of Mexican snacks. People are bound to leave these two areas of the park with a full stomach and a smile on their face. Dividing the playground from the courts is a building no one wants to be in: the public bathroom. Even if you really have to use it, the rule here is that you should hold it in or make a quick trip back to your house.
</p>

<p>   Next, passing by the medium-sized courts, you’ll be sure to glance over groups of young adults calling each other over and passing a ball around. Just by barely grasping at their words to decipher them, you would want to match their buzzing energy. You might even want to match your steps to the upbeat Latin music blasting on their radio. Finally, you know you've reached the end of the park when you can simply take a seat on one of the wooden benches next to the large trees. Despite this area being the less visited part of the park, here is where you see people of all ages come to relax. The elderly carry out the stereotype of using the chess tables to play cards or use the space for yoga stretches. Toddlers chase the pigeons around and young couples take strolls allowing you to quietly ponder over your visit. It is nice to wonder about what life they had lived that brought them to this routine before heading back home. That is the mystery of living in New York: while you share space with people, you are still far from ever fully understanding them. Though it’s best to appreciate that one glimpse of them in a simple setting.
</p>

<p>   Gorman Playground feels like a better fit than the parks I grew up near in Astoria. In Astoria, I always felt enclosed in the park in Athens Square because it was a small playground. Although Athens Square holds some cherished memories, they fall short to those memories and friendships I developed in Gorman Playground. This park is also centered in celebrating Greek culture and while that is amazing, Gorman Playground is more inclusive to those who are Hispanic. Here I see people who look like me, who speak my language, and who are at different stages in life. Even by asking this much sympathy from a public place, Gorman Playground has provided that sense of liberty with its wide open spaces and its ability to make your presence valued. It has an amazing orchestrated movement that is carried out every day that you can depend on despite the kind of day you are having.
</p>

<p>   The sense of security you get here is not like any other. For shy people who usually feel judged everywhere, they wouldn't feel obligated to do something or look a certain way at the park. When people visit Gorman Playground, the busy environment might cause them to be reluctant to visit. However, the diverse crowds is what makes the park shine and people can always come at any hour of the day to achieve a different emotion from it. People come here to be free of all the sadness, stress, and anger that life drowns them in. We have a human instinct to share the happiness we get from this place, which is why everyone is included in bringing out the beauty of this place.
